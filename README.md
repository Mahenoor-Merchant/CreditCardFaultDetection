# Credit Card Fault Detection Project

## Problem Statement:

Financial institutions face significant challenges in predicting credit risk due to the rapid advancements in the financial industry. One of the primary concerns for commercial banks is accurately predicting the probability of credit default among their clients. This project aims to address this issue by leveraging machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of credit default based on the characteristics of credit card owners and their payment history.

## Approach:

The project follows a structured approach to address the problem:

1. **Data Exploration**: Understand the dataset, its features, and distributions. Identify any patterns or anomalies that could impact the model's performance.
   
2. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This ensures that the data is suitable for modeling.
   
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve the predictive power of the model. This step involves selecting relevant features and encoding categorical variables.
   
4. **Model Building**: Experiment with various machine learning algorithms to find the most suitable model for predicting credit default. This may include techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting.

5. **Model Testing**: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy_score. Fine-tune the models if necessary to improve performance.

## Results:

The project aims to develop a solution capable of accurately predicting the probability of credit default based on the characteristics of credit card owners and their payment history. The success of the project will be measured by the model's ability to effectively identify and mitigate credit risks, thereby helping financial institutions make informed decisions.
